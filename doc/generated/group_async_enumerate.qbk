'''<indexterm><primary>async_enumerate</primary></indexterm>'''
Returns a callable which when called with a future<> schedules an asynchronous directory enumeration after a preceding operation. 

[heading Description]
By default dir() returns shared handles i.e. dir("foo") and dir("foo") will return the exact same handle, and therefore enumerating not all of the entries at once is a race condition. The solution is to either set maxitems to a value large enough to guarantee a directory will be enumerated in a single shot, or to open a separate directory handle using the file\u005fflags::unique\u005fdirectory\u005fhandle flag.

Note that setting maxitems=1 will often cause a buffer space exhaustion, causing a second syscall with an enlarged buffer. This is because AFIO cannot know if the allocated buffer can hold all of the filename being retrieved, so it may have to retry. Put another way, setting maxitems=1 will give you the worst performance possible, whereas maxitems=2 will probably only return one item most of the time.

[heading Synopsis]
``detail::async_enumerate async_enumerate(size_t _maxitems = 2, bool _restart = true, path _glob = path(),
                                        metadata_flags _metadata = metadata_flags::None, async_enumerate_op_req::filter _filtering = async_enumerate_op_req::filter::fastdeleted)``

[heading Parameters]

[table
[[Type] [Concept] [Name] [Description] ]
[[size_t] [] [_maxitems] [The maximum number of items to return in this request. Note that setting to one will often invoke two syscalls. ]]
[[bool] [] [_restart] [Restarts the enumeration for this open directory handle. ]]
[[path] [] [_glob] [An optional shell glob by which to filter the items returned. Done kernel side on Windows, user side on POSIX. ]]
[[metadata_flags] [] [_metadata] [The metadata to prefetch for each item enumerated. AFIO may fetch more metadata than requested if it is cost free. ]]
[[async_enumerate_op_req::filter] [] [_filtering] [Any filtering you want AFIO to do for you.]]
]


[heading Returns]
A callable with the specification future<T>(future<>)

[heading Race Guarantees][raceguarantees 
[raceguarantee FreeBSD, Linux, OS X..Race free per batch of up to ['maxitems] for ino and type only. Remember that
many filing systems will recycle inodes such that a created file will get the inode of a just deleted file, so
comparing inodes for equivalence to a direntry() won't help you.]
[raceguarantee Windows..Race free per batch of up to ['maxitems] for ino, type, atim, mtim, ctim, size, allocated,
birthtim, sparse, compressed.]

[heading Complexity]Amortised O(1) to dispatch. Amortised O(M) to complete where M is the average number of entries in each directory.
[heading Exception Model]Propagates exceptions of any input preconditions with an errored state at the point of dispatch, and throws a `std::invalid_argument` if any inputs have values which could not possibly be correct. Once a batch of input ops has been verified at the point of entry as not errored, you are guaranteed that the batch is atomically scheduled as a whole, unless a failure to allocate memory occurs.
