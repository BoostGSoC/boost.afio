[raceguarantee FreeBSD, OS X..Race free.]
[raceguarantee Linux..The following items are fetched in a single snapshot: bsize, iosize, blocks, bfree, bavail, files, ffree, namemax, fsid,
flags.rdonly, flags.noexec, flags.nosuid.]
[raceguarantee Windows..The following snapshot categories apply: (i) flags, namemax, fstypename (ii) bsize, blocks, bfree, bavail. Everything else
is fetched separately.]

[heading Complexity]Amortised O(1) to dispatch. Amortised O(1) to complete.
[heading Exception Model]Propagates exceptions of any input preconditions with an errored state at the point of dispatch, and throws a `std::invalid_argument` if any inputs have values which could not possibly be correct. Once a batch of input ops has been verified at the point of entry as not errored, you are guaranteed that the batch is atomically scheduled as a whole, unless a failure to allocate memory occurs.
