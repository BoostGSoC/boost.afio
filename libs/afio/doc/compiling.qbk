__boost_afio__ is a headers-only library. Users only need to include the 
library headers in their programs in order to be able to access definitions 
and algorithms provided by the __boost_afio__ library. No linking against 
any binaries is required. 

__boost_afio__ is only dependant on headers-only __boost__ libraries.
It does not introduce indirect dependencies on any binary libraries.

In order to be able to use __boost_afio__, the only thing users need to do 
is to download and/or install Boost  and specify location to include 
directories, so `include` directives of this scheme will work:

    #include <boost/...>
