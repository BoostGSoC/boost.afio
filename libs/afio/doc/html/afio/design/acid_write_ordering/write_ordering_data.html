<p>
          What you're about to read is probably too much detail for AFIO and reads
          more like a description of how the aforementioned forthcoming TripleGit
          graph store database implements durability. Nevertheless, as many users
          of AFIO will likely want to know how to ensure written data is never lost,
          this discussion is probably useful.
        </p>
<p>
          A performant way for a database to achieve the Consistent and Isolated
          part is to allow abortable, garbage collectable concurrent writes of new
          data into separate partitions, and to push the atomicity enforcement into
          a very small piece of ordering logic in order to reduce transaction contention
          by multiple writers as much as possible. Generally, the ordering logic
          will make use of some sort of intent log which records what the database
          intends to do (and generally you want that intent log on as low latency
          a device as possible). Generally speaking, that intent log is usually some
          form of atomically appended record -- and usefully every major filing system
          supports atomic appends to a file. What you then traditionally do to implement
          a transaction is to write your data to the filing system, ensure it has
          reached non-volatile storage, append the knowledge it definitely is on
          non-volatile storage to the intent log, and then ensure your append also
          has reached non-volatile storage. This is presently the only way to ensure
          that valuable data definitely can not be lost. The obvious problem is that
          this method involves writing all your data with <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">O_SYNC</span></code>
          and using <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          on the intent log. This might perform okay with a single writer, but with
          multiple writers performance is usually awful, especially on storage incapable
          of high queue depths and potentially many hundreds of milliseconds of latency
          (e.g. SD Cards).
        </p>
<p>
          This raises an alternative: write all your data, but keep a hash like a
          SHA of its contents as you write it. When you write your intent log, append
          all the SHAs of the items you just wrote and skip <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">O_DATA</span></code>
          and <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          completely. If power gets removed before all the data is written to non-volatile
          storage, you can figure out that the database is dirty easily enough, and
          you simply parse from the end of the intent log backwards, checking each
          item's contents to ensure their SHAs match up, throwing away any transaction
          where any file is missing or any file's contents don't match. On a filing
          system such as ext4 where data is guaranteed to be sent to non-volatile
          storage after one minute<a href="#ftn.afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f0" class="footnote" name="afio.design.acid_write_ordering.write_ordering_data.f0"><sup class="footnote">[5]</sup></a>, and of course so long as you don't mind losing up to one minute's
          worth of data, this solution can have much better performance than the
          previous solution with lots of simultaneous writers.
        </p>
<p>
          The problem though is that while better, performance is still far less
          than optimal. Firstly, you have to calculate a whole load of hashes all
          the time, and that isn't trivial especially on lower end platforms like
          a mobile phone where 25-30 cycles per byte SHA256 performance might be
          typical. Secondly, dirty database reconstruction is rather like how ext2
          had to call <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsck</span></code> on boot:
          a whole load of time and i/o must be expended to fix up damage in the store,
          and while it's running one generally must wait (one can work around this
          using metadata journaling to shortcut having to figure out what is good
          and bad, but I digress).
        </p>
<p>
          What would be really, really useful is if the filing system exposed its
          internal write ordering constraint implementation to user mode code, so
          one could say <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">schedule writing A, B, C and D in any order whenever
          you get round to it, but you <span class="emphasis"><em>must</em></span> write all of those
          before you write any of E, F and G</span>&#8221;</span>. Such an ability gives maximum
          scope to the filing system to reorder and coalesce writes as it sees fit,
          but still allows database implementations to ensure that a transaction's
          intent log entry can never appear without all the data it refers to. Such
          an ability would eliminate the need for expensive dirty database checking
          and reconstruction, or any journalling infrastructure used to skip the
          manual integrity checking.
        </p>
<p>
          In lieu of the lack of just such a facility, we can implementat a reasonable
          emulation in some circumstances. For some filing systems like btrfs or
          ZFS, or filing systems with certain mount options e.g. ext3/4 with the
          option journal=data, one knows that a file's modified timestamp <span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span> equals when it was last written to, and moreover
          one is guaranteed that a write is either fully applied or not (i.e. partial
          data writes, including desynchronisation of file contents from file metadata,
          is guaranteed to never happen). This lets you shortcut checking the intent
          log: simply rewind to where the intent log first matches the filing system
          metadata, and proceed to check intent log entries and filing system metadata
          for the duration which you know is the maximum time between <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">sync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          invocations by the system.
        </p>
<p>
          ZFS, interestingly, adds an even stronger guarantee due to its use of transaction
          groups which are, for all intents and purposes, partial snapshots issued
          once every five seconds in ZFSs before the addition of the ZFS Write Throttle.
          Data writes may occur in any order within a transaction group, but transaction
          group commits are strongly tied to the wall clock and are <span class="bold"><strong>always</strong></span>
          committed sequentially, and so long as it takes less than five seconds
          to write five seconds of buffered writes, all is good. Since the addition
          of the ZFS Write Throttle, the default settings are to buffer up to thirty
          seconds of writes before pacing the acceptance of new write data to match
          the speed of the non-volatile storage (which may be a ZIL if you're doing
          synchronous writes). This implies up to thirty seconds of buffered data
          could be lost, but note that ZFS still guarantees transaction group sequential
          write order.

<p>
          Additionally if the database user is savvy enough to place the data store
          in its own partition, manually calling something like Linux's <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">syncfs</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          more frequently than the system's cron job does will ensure that the distance
          between the end of the intent log and the most recently fully stored data
          isn't too long.
        </p>
<p>
          TODO FINISH.
        </p>
<p>
          In the hope that one day filing systems might actually expose their preexisting
          non-<code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">fsync</span><span class="special">()</span></code>
          write ordering constraints like I just described, AFIO makes available
          such a facility using the XXX <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">file_flags</span></code>
          member.
