[heading Values]

[table
[[Value] [Description] ]
[[none] [No flags set. ]]
[[read] [Read access. ]]
[[write] [Write access. ]]
[[read_write] [Read and write access. ]]
[[append] [Append only. ]]
[[truncate] [Truncate existing file to zero. ]]
[[create] [Open and create if doesn't exist. Always creates sparse files if possible. ]]
[[create_only_if_not_exist] [Create and open only if doesn't exist. ]]
[[create_compressed] [Create a compressed file, needs to be combined with one of the other create flags. Only succeeds if supported by the underlying filing system. ]]
[[will_be_sequentially_accessed] [Will be ['exclusively] either read or written sequentially. If you're exclusively writing sequentially, ['strongly] consider turning on [^`os_direct`] too. ]]
[[will_be_randomly_accessed] [Will be randomly accessed, so don't bother with read-ahead. If you're using this, ['strongly] consider turning on [^`os_direct`] too. ]]
[[no_sparse] [Don't create sparse files. May be ignored by some filing systems (e.g. ext4). ]]
[[hold_parent_open] [Hold a file handle open to the containing directory of each open file for fast directory enumeration and fast relative path ops. ]]
[[unique_directory_handle] [Return a unique directory handle rather than a shared directory handle. ]]
[[no_race_protection] [Skip taking steps to avoid destruction of data due to filing system races. Most of the performance benefit of enabling this goes away if you enable HoldParentOpen instead, so be especially careful when considering turning this on. ]]
[[temporary_file] [On some systems causes dirty cache data to not be written to physical storage until file close. Useful for temporary files and lock files, especially on Windows when combined with [^`delete_on_close`] as this avoids an fsync of the containing directory on file close. ]]
[[delete_on_close] [Only when combined with [^`create_only_if_not_exist`], deletes the file on close. This is especially useful on Windows with temporary and lock files where normally closing a file is an implicit fsync of its containing directory. Note on POSIX this unlinks the file on first close by AFIO, whereas on Windows the operating system unlinks the file on last close including sudden application exit. Note also that AFIO permits you to delete files which are currently open on Windows and the file entry disappears immediately just as on POSIX. ]]
[[os_direct] [Bypass the OS file buffers (only really useful for writing large files, or a lot of random reads and writes. Note you must 4Kb align everything if this is on). Be VERY careful mixing this with memory mapped files. ]]
[[os_lockable] []]
[[always_sync] [Ask the OS to not complete until the data is on the physical storage. Some filing systems do much better with this than [^`sync_on_close`]. ]]
[[sync_on_close] [Automatically initiate an asynchronous flush just before file close, and fuse both operations so both must complete for close to complete. ]]
[[int_hold_parent_open_nested] [Internal use only. Don't use. ]]
[[int_file_share_delete] [Internal use only. Don't use. ]]
[[int_opening_link] [Internal use only. Don't use. ]]
[[int_opening_dir] [Internal use only. Don't use. ]]
