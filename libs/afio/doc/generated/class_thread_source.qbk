[section:thread_source thread_source]

'''<indexterm><primary>thread_source</primary></indexterm>'''
Abstract base class for a source of thread workers. 

[heading Description]
Note that in Boost 1.54, and possibly later versions, [^`boost::asio::io_service`] on Windows appears to dislike being destructed during static data deinit, hence why this inherits from [^`std::enable_shared_from_this<>`] in order that it may be reference count deleted before static data deinit occurs. 

[heading Synopsis]
``class thread_source
      : public std::enable_shared_from_this< thread_source >
{
  // ...
};
``
