This directory contains filing system behaviour testing and results.
Simply compile and run the fs_probe executable with the current directory
in the filing system you are testing. It will output a YAML text file
with results for your filing system with a name based on your OS and
filing system.

The results directory contains standard runs of fs_probe for various
OS and filing systems.
